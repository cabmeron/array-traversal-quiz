Covered Concepts:

    1D Array Traversals

        Forward: Standard for (int i = 0; ...) loop.

        Backward: Iterating from the end of the array to the beginning.

        Skipping: Moving through an array with a step greater than one (e.g., i += 2).

    2D Grid (Matrix) Traversals

        Row-Major: The standard nested loop that completes one row at a time.

        Column-Major: A nested loop that completes one column at a time.

        Reverse Traversal: Iterating from the bottom-right corner to the top-left.

        Spiral Traversal: A classic algorithm that reads a matrix in an inward spiral.

    Dynamic Programming (DP) Patterns

        Standard DP: Iterating from [1, 1] when base cases are in the first row/column.

        Diagonal DP: Moving diagonally, common in string comparison problems.

    Pointer-Based Techniques

        Two Pointers (Inward): left and right pointers moving toward the center, often used for reversing arrays.

        Sliding Window: A window of a fixed or variable size that moves across an array, defined by left and right pointers.
